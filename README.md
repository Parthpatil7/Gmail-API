# Gmail Batch Email Sender

**This Python script facilitates the sending of batch emails using the Gmail API. It is particularly useful for scenarios where you need to send similar emails to multiple recipients in a controlled manner. The script is designed to handle the OAuth2 authentication process, allowing secure access to the Gmail API.**

## Features:

- **Batch Processing:** Send emails in batches to manage and control the volume of outgoing messages.
- **OAuth2 Authentication:** Safely authenticate with the Gmail API using OAuth2, ensuring secure access to the user's Gmail account.
- **Dynamic Message Content:** Customize the email message content to suit your specific needs.
- **Error Handling:** Detect and display errors, providing insights into potential issues during the email-sending process.

## How to Use:

1. **Set up Credentials:**
   - Define the sender's email address, path to the credentials file, and recipients file.
   - Specify the batch size for processing a specific number of recipients at a time.

2. **Load Recipients:**
   - Load recipient email addresses from a file (`recipients.txt` in this example).

3. **Authentication:**
   - Authenticate with the Gmail API using OAuth2. If no valid credentials are available, the script initiates the OAuth2 flow.

4. **Specify Batch:**
   - Prompt the user to enter the batch number, allowing processing a specific range of recipients.

5. **Compose and Send Emails:**
   - Generate and send personalized email messages to the recipients in the specified batch.

6. **Error Handling:**
   - Display any errors that may occur during the email-sending process, providing insights into potential issues.

## How to Run:

1. Ensure Python is installed on your machine.
2. Install required dependencies: `pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client`
3. Run the script: `python gmail_batch_sender.py`

**Feel free to customize the email message template and adapt the script to suit your specific use case. For more information on using the Gmail API, refer to the [official documentation](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api).**
